# iForum
Basic forum project built while learning Django.

## Notes
Due to my lack of understanding in the fundamentals of front end web development, I have found my ability to bring this project to an acceptable standard is limited. Because of this, I have decided to place this on hold while I am learning HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Express, and MongoDB.

One of my main interests is backend development; bringing functionality to a website is exhilarating. However every developer will be expected to be competent on front end. 

Features I would like to add to this project in future are listed in the roadmap below.

## Roadmap
- Style the forum with HTML & CSS
- Add user profile pages and profile pictures
- Customise registration forms such as signup and login
- Define slugs for pages without them, and improve existing slugs
- Ability to upload cover images and banners for forums
- Ability to upload images in threads
- Make forums private by default
- Make threads saved as drafts if not submitted
- Add user ability to see their drafts and forum visibility
- Add ability to see online and offline status of other users
